# Nested Pages for WordPress

Nested Pages provides an intuitive drag and drop interface for managing pages & posts in the WordPress admin, while maintaining quick edit functionality.

This fork is only to enable Links creation in CPT's as it's available by default only for pages.

For installation and usage information visit [nestedpages.com](http://nestedpages.com). Available for download/installation in the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-nested-pages).

## Compatibility
**Nested Pages requires PHP v5.3.2+ and WordPress v3.8+.**

**Why PHP 5.3.2+?:** Nested Pages takes advantage of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), specifically its PSR-4 auto-loading component. Because of this, the minimum version of PHP supported is 5.3.2.

**Why WordPress 3.8+?:** Nested Pages depends on admin theme changes introduced in WordPress 3.8.
